If you're getting the "Unable To Establish a Connection With the Gameserver" error, I found a way to play with friends since workshop map lobbies also don't work so far.
This entire guide was mainly made for this purpose.
It also doesn't require any port forwarding if you don't know how to do it or can't for some reason.

First of all, you all need to install an Hamachi-like app called ZeroTier One. It's used to make virtual lan connections between you and your friends.

You all need to install it from here: https://www.zerotier.com/download/

Only the one who is hosting the server needs to register and create a network on it.
The first thing you'll see is you have a network id, remember it exists.

You now have two options, make it private (you need to manually add your friends) or make it public (they can join by having the network id).
I honestly recommend using public because it's much faster, and noone is going to guess your network id anyway.

After you all installed it, if you try to open it, there won't appear any windows on your screen.
That's not because it's a virus, but because it's opened in the background, go to your background apps
(next to the language selector in windows there is an arrow) and click on it from there.
Press join new network and paste the network id.
Now you have successfully joined the network id.

How do you connect to the server after this?
The one who is hosting the server, open the app from the background apps thing, now you should see your own address,
example : a91amb71ka (10 letters and numbers)
Now go on the network configuration on the browser.
Scroll to the bottom and you'll see everyone who joined the network.
Recognize your own address and look at Managed IPs, that is the IP everyone needs to connect to after the server is open.
Example: 172.28.189.181\
!!!!!THIS ISN'T YOUR PHYSICAL IP!!!!!
